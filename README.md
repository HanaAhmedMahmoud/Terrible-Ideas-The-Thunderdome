# The Thunderdome  

## What is the Thunderdome?  
The Thunderdome is a fully immersive weather simulation system that brings history's storms, quakes, and natural disasters to life. Just enter your birthdate and location, and our system pulls real historical weather data. If a natural disaster happened on your birthday, you'll know about it, along with a special Easter egg for *Sharknado* fans (11/07/2013).  

## Demonstration
